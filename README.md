# IFB104-Assignment

This assignment is an online shopping program which lets its users select from several categories of products and view their prices. The shopper can choose to buy all the items on offer in a certain category, but has no choice over individual product selections. The shopper can also add products from each category to their shopping cart only once, due to temporary shortages. Products on offer are extracted from lists offered by “real” online shops. Two categories are derived from downloaded web documents and never change, but the other two categories are derived from "live" web documents that are updated frequently and may be different each time they are downloaded.

For this assignment, everything on the python file was given to us except the code marked under the comment 'solution', that was my solution. The HTML and other folders were the downloaded web documents that never change.

This project is not currently fully implemented as one of the live websites used to gather information has changed format and the Regular Expression used no longer works.

To run the program, run stay_home_shopping.py
