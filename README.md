# IFB104-Assignment

This assignment is an online shopping program which lets its users select from several categories of products and view their prices (in the GUI). The shopper can choose to buy all the items on offer in a certain category, but has no choice over individual product selections, i.e., purchases are “all or nothing”. Also, the shopper can add products from each category to their shopping cart only once, due to temporary shortages. Products on offer are extracted from lists offered by “real” online shops. Two categories are derived from previously downloaded web documents and never change, but the other two categories are derived from "live" web documents that are updated frequently and may be different each time they are downloaded.
